"""Custom script to run PyLint on google-cloud-happybase codebase.

This runs pylint as a script via subprocess in two different
subprocesses. The first lints the production/library code
using the default rc file (PRODUCTION_RC). The second lints the
test code using an rc file (TEST_RC) which allows more style
violations (hence it has a reduced number of style checks).
