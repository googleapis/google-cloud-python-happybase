       row mutations even if the context manager exits with an error.
       This behavior is in place to match the behavior in the HappyBase
       HBase / Thrift implementation.

    :type timestamp: int

                      that all mutations will be applied at.

    :type batch_size: int
    :param batch_size: (Optional) The maximum number of mutations to allow
                       to accumulate before committing them.

    :type transaction: bool
