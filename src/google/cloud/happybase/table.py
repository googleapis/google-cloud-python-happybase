        prefix will be returned. If given, ``row_start`` and ``row_stop``
        cannot be used.

            Both ``row_start`` and ``row_stop`` can be :data:`None` to specify
            the start and the end of the table respectively. If both are
            omitted, a full table scan is done. Note that this usually results
            in severe performance problems.

        The keyword argument ``filter`` is also supported (beyond column and
        row range filters supported here). HappyBase / HBase users will have
        used this as an HBase filter string. (See the `Thrift docs`_ for more
        details on those filters.) However, Google Cloud Bigtable doesn't
        support those filter strings so a
        :class:`~google.cloud.bigtable.row.RowFilter` should be used instead.

        The arguments ``batch_size``, ``scan_batching`` and ``sorted_columns``
        are allowed (as keyword arguments) for compatibility with
        HappyBase. However, they will not be used in any way, and will cause a
        warning if passed. (The ``batch_size`` determines the number of
        results to retrieve per request. The HBase scanner defaults to reading
        one record at a time, so this argument allows HappyBase to increase
        that number. However, the Cloud Bigtable API uses HTTP/2 streaming so
        there is no concept of a batched scan. The ``sorted_columns`` flag
        tells HBase to return columns in order, but Cloud Bigtable doesn't
        have this feature.)

                          ``row_start``, it will start from the next key after
